# pyaudio-record-stream
Program I used to learn how to continuously record audio streams.

Inspired by https://github.com/LearnedVector/A-Hackers-AI-Voice-Assistant/


Using PyAudio, extract a N blocks of M samples audio.  Number of samples for the file.
Save to a file.  Convention is <test<#>.wav.
```
python record_stream.py -f <filepath>
```

```
python test_recorded_stream.py -f <filepath>
```
